# ArduinoWifiNINAAndARest

This repository contains an example of using the ARest library (from https://github.com/marcoschwartz/aREST) together with the WifiNINA libraries that are compatible for Wifi programming with the Arduino Uno Wifi Rev 2.

It is built from the existing aREST example and the WifiNINA server example

It has been tested on an Arduino Uno Wifi Rev 2 upgraded to the 1.4.8 firmware
